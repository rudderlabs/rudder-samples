This is a sample application showing how to get the `appsFlyerId` using the bare minimum use of the AppsFlyer SDK and then pass it to the RudderStack SDK through an `identify` call so that the same value can be used in the cloud-mode implementation of AppsFlyer and RudderStack

Look for the specific sections in `MainApplication.java`
